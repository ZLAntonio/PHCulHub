            <h1>The Philippines</h1>
            <p>
                The Philippines comprises over 7,000 islands, yet the majority of its rapidly expanding population resides on only 11 of them. The country is characterized by rugged terrain, making it susceptible to earthquakes and volcanic activity due to approximately 20 active volcanoes. It frequently experiences typhoons and other severe weather conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having been a Spanish colony for more than three centuries and named after a 16th Century Spanish monarch, the Philippines came under US control in the early 20th Century after a prolonged rebellion against Spanish rule. The influences of both Spain and the United States continue to hold sway, particularly in terms of language, religion, and governance. The Philippines achieved self-governance in 1935 and full independence in 1946, adopting a constitution similar to that of the United States.

            <p>
                Maintaining a close alliance, the US has extended military assistance to aid in combating both Islamist and communist insurgencies in the region.
