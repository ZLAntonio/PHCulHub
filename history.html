            <h1>The Early Philippines</h1>
            <p>
                The Philippines, named after King Philip II of Spain, was a Spanish colony for over three centuries. Today, it's an archipelago of 7,000 islands. It's believed that during the last ice age, they were connected to mainland Asia by a land bridge.

                Initially, the Philippines were inhabited by hunter-gatherers, but between 3,000 BC and 2,000 BC, farming emerged. Rice cultivation and animal domestication became prevalent. Trade with China began in the 10th century AD, and by the 12th century AD, Arab merchants introduced Islam.

                In 1521, Ferdinand Magellan claimed the Philippines for Spain, but faced resistance from Chief Lapu Lapu, resulting in Magellan's demise. Spanish control solidified in 1565 under Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, who built a fort in Cebu. In 1571, they established Intramuros (later Manila), making it the capital. The Spaniards instituted a feudal system with vast estates worked by Filipinos.

                Accompanying conquistadors, friars converted Filipinos to Catholicism and established educational institutions. The Spanish colony brought prosperity primarily to the upper class. Annually, Chinese exports like silk, porcelain, and lacquer flowed to the Philippines and were re-exported to Mexico.

            <p>
                Peaceful years followed until 1762 when the British captured Manila. They held it for two years, returning it in 1764 through the Treaty of Paris signed in 1763.
