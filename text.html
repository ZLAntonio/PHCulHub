At that time, my parents had only my sister, born in 1980. I arrived in 1991, and my younger sister in 1997. It took 22 years for the petition filed in 1983 to become current in 2005. Until then, we had forgotten about it. Once notified, we completed the necessary steps for immigration. This included medical exams, paperwork, and an interview at the U.S. Embassy in Manila. In 2006, we received visas to move from the Philippines to Long Beach, California. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp">Carlos Briggs Camandang</a></div>
